# Weathr â€” A Current Weather Application for Windows, Mac & Linux

This is an open-source current weather forecaster using OpenWeatherMaps and PyQt5 library.
It is written in Python 3. If you are installing from source, make sure to sign up for
[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/ "OpenWeatherMap") and request a key.

## Install from Source

Currently their is not actual file to download and install
currently, so you have to download from the source. To do so, use the 
command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/henrybungee/weathr-forecast/
```

And you can compile from the source code with an IDE
of choice or run the MainWindow.py file. Or simply 
download the repository and run the files.

**I PROMISE THAT I WILL RELEASE AN ACTUAL FILE SOON**

But for now, if you want a copy, just run from the source
or use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/ "PyInstaller's Homepage")
to compile the MainWindow.py file to a .exe, a .AppImage
or a .app. 

## Features

Weathr is a simple tool. But I can give you
the basic information you need to operate the 
software. For starters, the first time you boot
up, your city should be set to New York. 



To change the city, click on the button that says
"Change City" (Simple enough, huh?).
